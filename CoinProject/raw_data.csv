In a sense you trust them more since a lot of people trusted them enough to buy it. Even with different ratings, gravitaed towards the number of sales sold with a higher rating.

This could just be because its what I'm used to but maybe a combination of both might be interesting.  I personally disliked seeing the number of ratings beside the stars. It somewhat adds extra thinking/cognitive load to the user having to look at 2 different numbers (number of ratings, number of sold) just to process if the rating is ""good"" or balanced. But it works well for the likes and the upvotes because you need more context with them. For the upvotes, it was hard to process immediately since I needed a bit more time to understand their percentages (for example in ""42 of 60 ratings"" I needed to contextualize if its majority upvote because they're both low numbers as opposed to ""200 of 250 ratings""). But overall thats just how I understood it."
